## tuto:

Click anywhere in the game, then click on the red ribbon extremity next to me to grab it.

Great! Now click the hand icon on the upper left corner to activate the swap mode.

Click the green ribbon extremity, then the yellow ribbon extremity to swap and disentangle them.

Click the upper left icon to go back to grab mode, then remove the two ribbons.

-------

I learned telekinesis! I can now grab ribbons even if
I can't reach them.

I learned super-telekinesis! I can now swap ribbons
even if I can't reach them.

I learned laser eyes, I can now see very far!
You can scroll the game area, with arrow keys or arrow icons.

I learned levitation! I can now directly grab a ribbon if it is above the others.

I learned planar shift! Click on a ribbon cross to magically reverse it. It will help me to put any ribbon above all the others.

## error messages

You must click on a ribbon extremity.

I can swap ribbons only if they cross just after
the two extremities you clicked.

I can't reach that ribbon extremity.

I can't reach that place.

One extremity of this ribbon is stuck under the wall. I guess I will need a specific power to be able to grab it.

These ribbons are blocked and entangled. I will need all the existing powers to grab them.

There are still mess in the room.

Ba... bu... bu... Daddy! Ba... bu... What is Christmas?

Hey Sweetie. Would you help me sort out those wrapping paper ribbons ?

Ho Dad. You look so smart. I'm sure you would be faster at doing it all by yourself. I would bother you if I try to help.

You've sorted out all the ribbon.
Thank you, honey! Would you help me for the Christmas Cookies?

My love, I learned levitation, planar shift and super-telekinesis!
Isn't it amazing?

Congrats. Please come in the kitchen. Those cookies won't cook by themselves.
